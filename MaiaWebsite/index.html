                <h3>What I admire most about her</h3>  
                    <p>I admire my sister because she is often the smartest person in a room, though rarely does she exploit that fact. She is forward-thinking in her compassion for others, and she empowers any person she helps. She is resilient in the face of adversity, and is always mindful to not step on others in order to further herself. Most importantly, she can laugh at herself, which is why she let me create this website (for a coding project) in the first place. And that, my friends, is real love.</p>
